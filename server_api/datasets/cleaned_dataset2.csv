Disease,Description,Symptoms,clean_symptoms
Allergies,"Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people.Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system.The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms.","Pain, burning, numbness, tingling, touch Sensitivity, red rash that begins a few days after the pain, Fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over, Itching, Fever, Headache, Sensitivity to light, Fatigue","pain, burn, numbness, tingle, touch sensitivity, itch, fever, headache, sensitivity light, fatigue"
Chickenpox,"Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Today, a vaccine is available that protects children against chickenpox. Routine vaccination is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).","Fever, Loss of appetite, Headache, Tiredness, feeling of being unwell, itchy, red rash that breaks out on the body, Skin that looks blotchy, Headache","fever, loss appetite, headache, tiredness, feel unwell, itchy, skin blotchy, headache"
Influenza,"Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach ""flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.For most people, the flu resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.","Fever, Aching muscles, Chills, sweats, Headache, persistent cough, Shortness of breath, Tiredness, feeling weak, stuffy nose, Sore throat, Eye pain, Vomiting, diarrhea","fever, ache muscle, chill, sweat, headache, persistent cough, shortness breath, tiredness, feel weak, stuffy nose, sore throat, eye pain, vomit, diarrhea"
Common cold,"The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.Healthy adults can expect to have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have even more frequent colds.Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Generally, you don't need medical attention for a common cold.","Sneezing, Stuffy nose, Runny nose, Sore throat, Coughing, Mucus dripping down your throat, Watery eyes","sneeze, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, cough, mucus drip throat, watery eye"
"Conjunctivitis (""pink eye“)","Pink eye (conjunctivitis) is an inflammation or infection of the transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. When small blood vessels in the conjunctiva become inflamed, they're more visible. This is what causes the whites of your eyes to appear reddish or pink.Pink eye is commonly caused by a bacterial or viral infection, an allergic reaction, or — in babies — an incompletely opened tear duct.","Pink color in the eye, red color in the eye, Swelling of eyelids, Itching, irritation, burning, Discharge pus , Redness in one eye, Redness in both eyes, A gritty feeling in one eye, A gritty feeling in both eyes, A discharge in one eye that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning, A discharge in both eyes that forms a crust during the night that may prevent your eye or eyes from opening in the morning, Tearing","pink color eye, red color eye, swell eyelid, itch, irritation, burn, discharge pus, redness eye, redness eye, gritty feeling eye, gritty feeling eye, tear"
Diarrhea,"Diarrhea — loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements — is a common problem. It may be present alone or be associated with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or weight loss.Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. But when diarrhea lasts beyond a few days into weeks, it usually indicates that there's another problem — such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a more serious disorder, including persistent infection, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","Abdominal cramps, Abdominal pain, Bloating, Nausea, Vomiting, Fever, Blood in the stool, Mucus in the stool, Urgent need to have a bowel movement, pain in the abdomen","abdominal cramp, abdominal pain, bloat, nausea, vomit, fever, blood stool, mucus stool, urgent bowel movement, pain abdoman"
Diphtheria,"Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection that usually affects the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. Diphtheria is extremely rare in the United States and other developed countries thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. However, many countries with limited health care or vaccination options still experience high rates of diphtheria.Diphtheria can be treated with medications. But in advanced stages, diphtheria can damage the heart, kidneys and nervous system. Even with treatment, diphtheria can be deadly, especially in children.","A thick gray membrane covering the throat, A thick gray membrane covering the tonsils, A sore throat, hoarseness, Swollen glands in the neck, Difficulty breathing, Nasal discharge, Fever, chills, Tiredness","sore throat, hoarseness, swollen gland neck, difficulty breathe, nasal discharge, fever, chill, tiredness"
E. coli,"Escherichia coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. Most types of E. coli are harmless or cause relatively brief diarrhea. But a few strains, such as E. coli, can cause severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.You may be exposed to E. coli from contaminated water or food — especially raw vegetables and undercooked ground beef. Healthy adults usually recover from infection with E. coli within a week. Young children and older adults have a greater risk of developing a life-threatening form of kidney failure.","Diarrhea, Stomach cramping, Stomach pain , Stomach tenderness, Nausea, vomiting","diarrhea, stomach cramp, stomach pain, stomach tenderness, nausea, vomit"
Gastrointestinal (GI) Illness,"Gastrointestinal (GI) illness is caused by a variety of different disease-causing microbes or germs that can be acquired by consuming contaminated food or beverages, contact with contaminated recreational water, infected animals or their environments, or infected people.","Bloating, Excess Gas, Constipation, Diarrhea, Heartburn, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal Pain","bloat, excess gas, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomit, abdominal pain"
Genital Warts,"Genital warts are one of the most common types of sexually transmitted infections. Nearly all sexually active people will become infected with at least one type of human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts, at some point during their lives.Genital warts affect the moist tissues of the genital area. They can look like small, flesh-colored bumps or have a cauliflower-like appearance. In many cases, the warts are too small to be visible.","Bleeding, Brown colored bumps near the Vagina, Mucous like discharge, A person with anal warts may also feel like they have a lump in their Vaginal area, A cauliflower like shape caused by several warts close together, Itching in your genital area","bleed, mucous discharge, itch genital area"
Giardia,"Giardia infection is an intestinal infection marked by stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and bouts of watery diarrhea. Giardia infection is caused by a microscopic parasite that is found worldwide, especially in areas with poor sanitation and unsafe water.Giardia infection (giardiasis) is one of the most common causes of waterborne disease in the United States. The parasites are found in backcountry streams and lakes but also in public water supplies, swimming pools, whirlpool spas and wells. Giardia infection can be spread through food and person-to-person contact.","Diarrhea, Stomach cramps, Stomach pain, Upset stomach , Dehydration, Fatigue, Stomach cramps, Stomach bloating, Gas, Nausea, Weight loss","diarrhea, stomach cramp, stomach pain, upset stomach, dehydration, fatigue, stomach cramp, stomach bloat, gas, nausea, weight loss"
Glanders,"Glanders is an infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei. While people can get the disease, glanders is primarily a disease affecting horses. It also affects donkeys and mules and can be naturally contracted by other mammals such as goats, dogs, and cats.","Fever, chills, sweating, Muscle aches, Chest pain, Muscle tightness, Headache, Nasal discharge, Light sensitivity, Excessive tearing of the eyes","fever, chill, sweat, muscle ache, chest pain, muscle tightness, headache, nasal discharge, light sensitivity, excessive tearing eye"
Gonorrhea,"Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that infects both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix.Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sex. But babies of infected mothers can be infected during childbirth. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes.","Painful urination, Pus like discharge from the tip of the penis, Pain in one testicle, swelling in one testicle, Increased vaginal discharge, Vaginal bleeding between periods, Abdominal pain, pelvic pain","painful urination, pain testicle, swell testicle, increase vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding period, abdominal pain, pelvic pain"
HIV/AIDS,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood and from illicit injection drug use or sharing needles. It can also be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.","Fever, Headache, Muscle aches, joint pain, Rash, Sore throat, painful mouth sores, Swollen lymph glands, Diarrhea, Weight loss, Cough, Night sweats, Rapid weight loss, Recurring fever, profuse night sweats, tiredness, Pneumonia, Memory loss","fever, headache, muscle ache, joint pain, rash, sore throat, painful mouth sore, swollen lymph gland, diarrhea, weight loss, cough, night sweat, rapid weight loss, recur fever, profuse night sweat, tiredness, pneumonia, memory loss"
Infectious mononucleosis,"Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease. The virus that causes mono (Epstein-Barr virus) is spread through saliva. You can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're a teen or young adult. Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes undiagnosed.","extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, head and body aches, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, Skin rash, Soft, swollen spleen, rash, Headache","extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, head body ache, skin rash, soft, swollen spleen, rash, headache"
Legionellosis,"Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia — lung inflammation usually caused by infection. It's caused by a bacterium known as legionella.Most people catch Legionnaires' disease by inhaling the bacteria from water or soil. Older adults, smokers and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to Legionnaires' disease.The legionella bacterium also causes Pontiac fever, a milder illness resembling the flu. Pontiac fever usually clears on its own, but untreated Legionnaires' disease can be fatal.","Headache, Muscle aches, Fever 104 F or higher, Cough which might bring up mucus, Cough which might bring up blood, Shortness of breath, Chest pain, nausea , vomiting, diarrhea","headache, muscle ache, cough bring mucus, cough bring blood, shortness breath, chest pain, nausea, vomit, diarrhea"
Leprosy,"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, an acid-fast, rod-shaped bacillus. The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and the eyes. Leprosy is curable and treatment in the early stages can prevent disability.","Discolored patches of skin, Growths on the skin, Thick stiff, dry skin, Painless ulcers on the soles of feet, Painless swelling, lumps on the face, lumps on the earlobes, Loss of eyebrows, Loss of eyelashes","discolor patch skin, growth skin, thick stiff, dry skin, painless swelling, lump, lump earlobe, loss eyebrow, loss eyelash"
Listeria,"Listeria infection is a foodborne bacterial illness that can be very serious for pregnant women, people older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems. It's most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products.Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but the disease can be fatal to unborn babies, newborns and people with weakened immune systems. Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.Listeria bacteria can survive refrigeration and even freezing. So people who are at higher risk of serious infections should avoid eating the types of food most likely to contain listeria bacteria.","Fever, Chills, Muscle aches, Nausea, Diarrhea, Headache, Stiff neck, Confusion, changes in alertness, Loss of balance, Convulsions","fever, chill, muscle ache, nausea, diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, change alertness, loss balance, convulsion"
Lyme Disease,"Lyme disease is caused by four main species of bacteria. Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.You're more likely to get Lyme disease if you live or spend time in grassy and heavily wooded areas where ticks carrying Lyme disease thrive.","Fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, joint aches, swollen lymph nodes, rashes, Facial palsy , loss of muscle tone on one side of the face, loss of muscle tone on both sides of the face, an irregular heart beat , shortness of breath, Inflammation of the brain, Inflammation of the spinal cord, Nerve pain, Shooting pains, numbness, tingling in the hands, tingling in the feet","fever, chill, headache, fatigue, muscle ache, joint ache, swollen lymph node, rash, facial palsy, irregular heart beat, shortness breath, inflammation brain, inflammation spinal cord, nerve pain, shooting pain, numbness, tingle hand, tingle foot"
Malaria,Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills.,"Chills,General feeling of discomfort,Headache,Nausea vomiting,Diarrhea,Abdominal pain,Muscle,joint pain,Fatigue,Rapid breathing,Rapid heart rate","chill, general feeling discomfort, headache, nausea vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle, joint pain, fatigue, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate"
Measles,"Measles is a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine.Also called rubeola, measles spreads easily and can be serious and even fatal for small children. While death rates have been falling worldwide as more children receive the measles vaccine, the disease still kills more than 200,000 people a year, mostly children","A high fever,Tiredness,A barky cough,Red or bloodshot eyes,A runny nose,A red rash which starts at the head and then spreads downward,A sore throat,White spots in the mouth,Muscle pain,light Sensitivity","high fever, tiredness, barky cough, red bloodshot eye, runny nose, sore throat, white spot mouth, muscle pain, light sensitivity"
Meningitis,"Meningitis is an inflammation of the fluid and membranes (meninges) surrounding your brain and spinal cord.The swelling from meningitis typically triggers signs and symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck.,Most cases of meningitis in the United States are caused by a viral infection, but bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections are other causes. Some cases of meningitis improve without treatment in a few weeks. Others can be life-threatening and require emergency antibiotic treatment.","Sudden high fever,Stiff neck,Severe headache that seems different from normal,Headache with nausea, Headache with vomiting,Confusion, difficulty concentrating,Seizures,Sleepiness, difficulty waking,light Sensitivity,No appetite, no thirst,Skin rash","sudden high fever, stiff neck, headache nausea, headache vomiting, confusion, difficulty concentrate, seizure, sleepiness, difficulty wake, light sensitivity, appetite, thirst, skin rash"
Mononucleosis,"Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is often called the kissing disease. The virus that causes mono (Epstein-Barr virus) is spread through saliva. You can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono. However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the common cold.You're most likely to get mononucleosis with all the signs and symptoms if you're a teen or young adult. Young children usually have few symptoms, and the infection often goes undiagnosed.If you have mononucleosis, it's important to be careful of certain complications such as an enlarged spleen. Rest and enough fluids are keys to recovery.","extreme fatigue,fever,sore throat,head aches, body aches,swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits,swollen liver, swollen spleen,rash","extreme fatigue, fever, sore throat, head ache, body ache, swollen liver, swollen spleen, rash"
Mumps,Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects saliva-producing (salivary) glands that are located near your ears. Mumps can cause swelling in one or both of these glands.,"Pain in the swollen salivary glands on one, Pain in the swollen salivary glands on both sides of your face,Pain while chewing, Pain while swallowing,Fever,Headache,Muscle aches,Weakness, fatigue,Loss of appetite","pain chew, pain swallow, fever, headache, muscle ache, weakness, fatigue, loss appetite"
Necrotizing Fasciitis,"Necrotizing fasciitis is a type of soft tissue infection. It can destroy the tissue in your skin and muscles as well as subcutaneous tissue, which is the tissue beneath your skin.Necrotizing fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus, commonly known as “flesh-eating bacteria.” This is the fastest moving form of the infection. When this infection is caused by other types of bacteria, it typically doesn’t progress as quickly and isn’t quite as dangerous.This bacterial skin infection is rare in healthy people, but it’s possible to get this infection from even a tiny cut, so it’s important to be aware of the symptoms if you’re at risk. You should see your doctor immediately if you have symptoms or believe that you may have developed the infection. Because the condition can progress quickly, it’s vital to treat it as early as possible.","A red area of skin that spreads quickly, warm area of skin that spreads quickly, swollen area of skin that spreads quickly,Severe pain, including pain beyond the area of the skin that is red, pain beyond the area of the skin that is warm, pain beyond the area of the skin that is swollen,Fever,Ulcers,blisters,black spots on the skin,Changes in the color of the skin,Pus from the infected area, oozing from the infected area,Dizziness,Fatigue,tiredness,Diarrhea,nausea","severe pain, fever, ulcer, blister, black spot skin, change color skin, pu infected area, ooze infected area, dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, diarrhea, nausea"
Nipah Virus,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it can spread between animals and people. Fruit bats, also called flying foxes, are the animal reservoir for NiV in nature. Nipah virus is also known to cause illness in pigs and people. Infection with NiV is associated with encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and can cause mild to severe illness and even death. Outbreaks occur almost annually in parts of Asia, primarily Bangladesh and India.Nipah virus infection can be prevented by avoiding exposure to sick pigs and bats in areas where the virus is present, and not drinking raw date palm sap which can be contaminated by an infected bat. During an outbreak, standard infection control practices can help prevent person-to-person spread in hospital settings.","Fever,Headache,Cough,Sore throat,Difficulty breathing,Vomiting,Disorientation,drowsiness,confusion,Seizures,Coma,Brain swelling (encephalitis)","fever, headache, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathe, vomit, disorientation, drowsiness, confusion, seizure, coma"
Norovirus,"Norovirus infection can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea that start suddenly. Noroviruses are highly contagious. They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection.Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus infection symptoms usually last 1 to 3 days. Most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially young children, older adults and people with other medical conditions — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention.Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments. Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships.","diarrhea,vomiting,nausea,stomach pain,fever,headache,body aches","diarrhea, vomit, nausea, stomach pain, fever, headache, body ache"
Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.","Chest pain when you breathe, Chest pain when you cough,Confusion,changes in mental awareness in adults aged 65, changes in mental awareness in adults older than 65,Cough with phlegm,Fatigue,Fever,sweating,shaking chills,Lower than normal body temperature in adults older than age 65, Lower than normal body temperature in people with weak immune systems,Nausea,vomiting,diarrhea,Shortness of breath","chest pain breathe, chest pain cough, confusion, cough phlegm, fatigue, fever, sweat, shake chill, nausea, vomit, diarrhea, shortness breath"
Poliomyelitis (polio),"Polio is a contagious viral illness that in its most severe form causes nerve injury leading to paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death.In the U.S., the last case of naturally occurring polio was in 1979. Today, despite a worldwide effort to wipe out polio, poliovirus continues to affect children and adults in parts of Asia and Africa.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises taking precautions to protect yourself from polio if you're traveling anywhere there's a risk of polio.Adults who have been vaccinated who plan to travel to an area where polio is occurring should receive a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.","Fever,Sore throat,Headache,Vomiting,Fatigue,Back pain,stiff back,Neck pain,stiff neck,Pain in the arms or legs, stiffness in the arms or legs,Muscle weakness, Muscle tenderness","fever, sore throat, headache, vomit, fatigue, back pain, stiff back, neck pain, stiff neck, pain arm leg, stiffness arm leg, muscle weakness, muscle tenderness"
Rocky mountain spotted fever,"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a bacterial infection transmitted by a tick. Without prompt treatment, Rocky Mountain spotted fever can cause serious damage to internal organs, such as your kidneys and heart.Although it was first identified in the Rocky Mountains, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is most commonly found in the southeastern part of the United States. It also occurs in parts of Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America.Early signs and symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include a severe headache and high fever. A few days later, a rash usually appears on the wrists and ankles. Rocky Mountain spotted fever responds well to prompt treatment with antibiotics.","Fever,Headache,Rash,Nausea,Vomiting,Stomach pain,Muscle pain,Lack of appetite","fever, headache, rash, nausea, vomit, stomach pain, muscle pain, lack appetite"
Rubella (German measles),"Rubella is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. It's also called German measles or three-day measles. This infection may cause mild or no symptoms in most people. However, it can cause serious problems for unborn babies whose mothers become infected during pregnancy.Rubella isn't the same as measles, but the two illnesses share some signs and symptoms, such as the red rash. Rubella is caused by a different virus than measles, and rubella isn't as infectious or as severe as measles.","a low-grade fever,headache,mild pink eye ,redness of eye,swelling of the white of the eye,general discomfort,swollen lymph nodes, enlarged lymph nodes,cough,runny nose","headache, mild pink eye, redness eye, swell white eye, general discomfort, swollen lymph node, enlarged lymph node, cough, runny nose"
Salmonella infections,"Salmonella infection (salmonellosis) is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through stool (feces). Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.Some people with salmonella infection have no symptoms. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach (abdominal) cramps within 8 to 72 hours after exposure. Most healthy people recover within a few days to a week without specific treatment.In some cases, diarrhea can cause severe dehydration and requires prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also may develop if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. The risk of getting salmonella infection is higher with travel to countries without clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.","Diarrhea,Stomach cramps,Fever,Nausea,Vomiting,Chills,Headache,Blood in the stool","diarrhea, stomach cramp, fever, nausea, vomit, chill, headache, blood stool"
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness. SARS first appeared in China in November 2002. Within a few months, SARS spread worldwide, carried by unsuspecting travelers.SARS showed how quickly infection can spread in a highly mobile and interconnected world. On the other hand, a collaborative international effort allowed health experts to quickly contain the spread of the disease. There has been no known transmission of SARS anywhere in the world since 2004.","fever over 100.4°F (38°C),dry cough,sore throat,breathing issues,shortness of breath,headache,body aches,loss of appetite,malaise,night sweats, chills,confusion,rash,diarrhea","dry cough, sore throat, breathing issue, shortness breath, headache, body ache, loss appetite, malaise, night sweat, chill, confusion, rash, diarrhea"
Sexually transmitted diseases,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) — or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — are generally acquired by sexual contact. The bacteria, viruses or parasites that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids.Sometimes these infections can be transmitted nonsexually, such as from mothers to their infants during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.STIs don't always cause symptoms. It's possible to contract sexually transmitted infections from people who seem perfectly healthy and may not even know they have an infection.","Sores on the genitals, bumps on the genitals,sores in oral, bumps in oral, sores in the rectal area, bumps in the rectal area,Painful urination,burning urination,Discharge from the penis,Unusual vaginal discharge, odorous vaginal discharge,Unusual vaginal bleeding,Pain during sex,Sore lymph nodes particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread, swollen lymph nodes particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread,Lower abdominal pain,Fever,Rash over the trunk,Rash on the hands,Rash on the feet","sore genital, bump genital, sore oral, bump oral, sore rectal area, bump rectal area, painful urination, burn urination, discharge penis, unusual vaginal discharge, odorous vaginal discharge, unusual vaginal bleeding, pain sex, low abdominal pain, fever, rash trunk, rash hand, rash foot"
Shingles (herpes zoster),"Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. Although shingles can occur anywhere on your body, it most often appears as a single stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of your torso.Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus — the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you've had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles.Shingles isn't a life-threatening condition, but it can be very painful. Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles. Early treatment can help shorten a shingles infection and lessen the chance of complications. The most common complication is postherpetic neuralgia, which causes shingles pain for a long time after your blisters have cleared.","Pain, burning, numbness, tingling,Sensitivity to touch,A red rash that begins a few days after the pain,Fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over,Itching,Fever,Headache,light Sensitivity,Fatigue","pain, burn, numbness, tingle, sensitivity touch, itch, fever, headache, light sensitivity, fatigue"
Tetanus,"Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries.","Jaw cramping,Sudden, involuntary muscle tightening (muscle spasms) – often in the stomach,Painful muscle stiffness all over the body,Trouble swallowing,Jerking,twitching,seizures,Headache,Fever, sweating,Changes in blood pressure, fast heart rate","jaw cramp, sudden, trouble swallow, jerk, twitch, seizure, headache, fever, sweat, change blood pressure, fast heart rate"
Toxic shock syndrome,"Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, life-threatening complication of certain types of bacterial infections. Often toxic shock syndrome results from toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria, but the condition may also be caused by toxins produced by group A streptococcus (strep) bacteria.Toxic shock syndrome can affect anyone, including men, children and postmenopausal women. Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons and other devices, such as menstrual cups, contraceptive sponges or diaphragms.","high temperature,flu-like symptoms,headache,feeling cold,feeling tired,aching body,sore throat,cough,feeling sick, being sick,diarrhoea,widespread sunburn-like rash,lips turning a bright red, tongue turning a bright red, the whites of the eyes turning a bright red,dizziness,fainting,difficulty breathing,confusion","high temperature, flu  symptom, headache, feel cold, feel tired, ache body, sore throat, cough, feel sick, sick, diarrhoea, dizziness, faint, difficulty breathe, confusion"
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from person to person through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.Once rare in developed countries, tuberculosis infections began increasing in 1985, partly because of the emergence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's immune system, so it can't fight the TB germs. In the United States, because of stronger control programs, tuberculosis began to decrease again in 1993. But it remains a concern.Many tuberculosis strains resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take many types of medications for months to get rid of the infection and prevent antibiotic resistance.","Coughing for three,Coughing for more than three weeks,Coughing up blood,Coughing up mucus,Chest pain,pain with breathing,Unintentional weight loss,Fatigue,Fever,Night sweats,Chills,Loss of appetite","cough, cough week, cough blood, cough mucus, chest pain, pain breathing, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweat, chill, loss appetite"
Viral hepatitis ,"Viral hepatitis is an infection that causes liver inflammation and damage. Inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs. Researchers have discovered several different viruses NIH external link that cause hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.","fatigue,flu-like symptoms,dark urine,pale stool,abdominal pain,loss of appetite,unexplained weight loss,yellow skin, yellow eyes, which may be signs of jaundice","fatigue, flu  symptom, dark urine, pale stool, abdominal pain, loss appetite, unexplained weight loss, yellow skin, yellow eye, sign jaundice"
West Nile virus,"A mosquito-transmitted virus causes most cases of West Nile infection. Most people infected with West Nile virus either don't develop signs or symptoms or have only minor ones, such as a fever and mild headache. However, some people develop a life-threatening illness that includes inflammation of the spinal cord or brain.Mild signs and symptoms of a West Nile virus infection generally go away on their own. But severe signs and symptoms — such as a severe headache, fever, disorientation or sudden weakness — need immediate attention.Exposure to mosquitoes where West Nile virus exists increases your risk of getting infected. You can lower your risk by protecting yourself from mosquitoes by using mosquito repellent and wearing clothing that covers your skin.","fever,confusion,convulsions,muscle weakness,vision loss,numbness,paralysis,coma,headache,body aches,nausea,vomiting,swollen lymph glands,rash on your chest,rash on your stomach,rash on your back","fever, confusion, convulsion, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness, paralysis, coma, headache, body ache, nausea, vomit, swollen lymph gland, rash chest, rash stomach, rash back"
Whooping cough (pertussis),"Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In many people, it's marked by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like whoop.Before the vaccine was developed, whooping cough was considered a childhood disease. Now whooping cough primarily affects children too young to have completed the full course of vaccinations and teenagers and adults whose immunity has faded.Deaths associated with whooping cough are rare but most commonly occur in infants. That's why it's so important for pregnant women — and other people who will have close contact with an infant — to be vaccinated against whooping cough.","Runny nose,Low-grade fever (generally minimal throughout the course of the disease),Mild cough, occasional cough,Apnea – a pause in breathing (in babies),Paroxysms (fits) of many rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched “whoop” sound,Vomiting (throwing up) during coughing fits, Vomiting (throwing up) after coughing fits,Exhaustion (very tired) after coughing fits","runny nose, mild cough, occasional cough"
